In this weeks lab, we are still having issues with attempting to push last week's work to the master branch, 
conflict between last week's work and work in the master branch still occurs. although we have tried to sort the conflict problems, 
it is still not merging. we are going to overcome this issue by seeking help from Tom. 
also, this week we have used the dimensions tables which we made last week to populate a fact table.
This is where the fact table consists of multiple dimension tables e.g, Date and Time.
so far, creating the fact table is going well and we plan to fiinish this by next week.
