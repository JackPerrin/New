What did you achieve during this week?  Include what went well – what didn’t go well
and what you plan to do about any issues. (150 - 200 words)

This week in the lab we tried to push last week’s lab work to the master, 
We had a lot of problems with doing this the problem was to do with the original master which kept conflicting with the new master. 
We tried a number of things and couldn't get the merge what we ended up doing this deleting everything in the old master and pushing the new branch.
Then creating a pull request so there won't be any conflicts. 
So what we decided to do was to just work on one pc and complete week 23 lab work as a team. 
We found the lab work no problems and added data lists that contain all of the data we wanted too. 
But found getting the items in the correct format, was hard until we used, format that was given to use
Apart from that the work was no problem and we should be ready for the assignment.
