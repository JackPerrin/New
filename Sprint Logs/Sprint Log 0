This week in the labs we created the team’s repository for
our Business Intelligence system. Once we had created the Repository the team
and each member had been invited, we had to mirror a repository that had
already been created that will be basis of our project, by mirroring a
repository we are able to change the code and make it our own and make as many
changes as we need to do. Once one person in the team had created the teams
repository, all the members of the team had to make sure the first source
database was accessible. Once this was working and we accessed the database we
had to create a sheet called ‘Sheet1’ and execute a SQL query with different
dates [Order Date] and [Ship Date], then on the main Program form we had to put
a list box and a button. The button gives us an easy trigger to start the
process and the list box allows us to confirm what different data we are receiving.
